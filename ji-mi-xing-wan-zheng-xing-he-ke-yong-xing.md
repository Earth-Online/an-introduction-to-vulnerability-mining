# Confidentiality, integrity and availability

Confidentiality, integrity and availability are also known as CIA triples

It is a security model, and this book introduces it because it is the expected behavior of a general system.

## Confidentiality

| input | limit | output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Unauthorized access |  | Refuse |
| Authorized access |  | Privacy information |

This authorization means that the actual system administrator allows access.

Rather than referring to the account password or any credentials, the account password will cause the attacker to obtain the account password and it is not against confidentiality.

## Integrity

Integrity is similar to confidentiality, just changing from private information to allowing changes to information

## Availability

| input | limit | influences |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Operation of the system | Authorized | Affect system status |
| Other operations |  | System normal output |
