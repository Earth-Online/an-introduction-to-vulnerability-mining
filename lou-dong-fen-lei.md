# Vulnerability classification

Each category is for the needs of the classifier, and this book is no exception. There will be no objectivity or irrationality. 

The following classifications are mainly classified according to the functions of the system, but are designed for convenience of explanation and should not be perfected.

## Access restriction system

| input | limit | output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Access restriction system |  | pass |
| Unauthorized access |  | Not allowed to pass |

Unexpected behavior against incorrect credentials is generally referred to as landing bypass. 

Systems with access restriction systems will have expected behavior

| input | limit | output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Any operation | The power is not more than expected | Can't get the correct credentials |
| Any operation |  | Cannot forge authorization request |

The power of calculation does not exceed the expected limit because for any kind of encryption system, through enough calculations, you can always get the correct credentials. The same is true for login. As long as you try enough, you can always try the correct account password. If there are unexpected problems in the system, you can get the correct credentials with a few operations. There is a Vulnerability.

## Code execution

The code execution here means that the input goes into any of the interpreters that are executed. For example sql, xml, shell.

If the input results in an unexpected execution result, there is a corresponding type of code injection vulnerability. In fact, there are corresponding nouns according to different types. For example

* sql  - sql injection
* xml - Xml entity injection
* shell - Command execution

The test criteria is to see if it affects the execution of the code and whether this effect is harmful.

## Object selection

The system always has to choose. The username and password are the user? Is the article id the article? It also makes selections based on user input, which raises a question. The user can choose whether the range is within the expected range.

| input | limit | output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| select | Within the selectable range | info |
| select | Not in the range of choice | reject |

If this system encounters unexpected behavior, it usually leads to over-authorization. View information that should not be viewable

## Store

The system stores the input in any format. The most common is to upload the file. Depending on the type of storage, the vulnerability is different and the expected. The uploaded file may be expected to be un-accessed after uploading.
