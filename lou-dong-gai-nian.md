# Vulnerability concept

Before defining the vulnerabilities in this book, you need to define other terms used..

The object of the vulnerability is called the system. The system mentioned here will be generalized, accepting input and getting output. Each system can be treated as a black box, accepting one input and getting an output.

For example, Google search engine accepts search keywords and returns search results..

Analysis of the system can be divided into multiple subsystems, each system accepting an input, getting an output, and forming a whole.

For example, a typical website can be divided into front-end web pages, back-end servers, and databases.

Obviously making every system, its developers have his system expected behavior. This expectation can be written as a matrix \(specific format depends on the system\)

For example, a system that sells oranges \(The price is one dollar a kilogram\)

| input | limit | output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Buy N pounds of oranges" and pay | Pay more than N | Successful transaction, balance -N |
| "Buy N pounds of oranges" and pay | Pay less than N | Refuse |
| Buy N pounds of oranges and pay no money |  | Refuse |

If there is a problem in the design or implementation, the behavior beyond the expected is called a bug..

In reality, no one buys oranges and chooses to buy 0 pounds, but 0 can appear in the system input, and then there will be no use orders.

If the input is negative, the unanticipated behavior of the balance -\(-x\) = balance +x will appear in the above expectation. This behavior is obviously a threat, and you can recharge your balance for free. This is called a vulnerability.

Basic conditions for the existence of a vulnerability

* Input can be controlled
* There are problems with system limitations

If the system input for purchasing oranges is uncontrollable, you cannot enter 0 or a negative number. There is no vulnerability.

If the limit is added, N&gt;0, you cannot enter 0 or a negative number.
