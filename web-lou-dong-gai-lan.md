# Web vulnerability overview

If the web is deep enough/in-depth, this overview is actually unnecessary. If not, this overview can provide some of the types of vulnerabilities that will be encountered in vulnerability mining to prevent it from falling into development expectations. 

## Sql injection 

The sql type in the code execution system, the use of the database exists using sql, there is the possibility of sql injection.

##  XSS 

The html type in the code execution system, the web server will generally return an html, if the input is inserted into the html, there may be XSS. 

## File Upload 

The file type of the storage system. If the server allows uploading of html and accepts access in html format, the html code can be used to access the user. 

## CSRF

 Cross-site request forgery mainly exploits the unintended behavior of requesting credentials. JavaScript can falsify user requests. If only cookies are used as credentials, the access restriction system can be bypassed. This is a system design flaw. 

## XXE 

The xml type in the code execution system, the xml parsing allows running system commands and other harmful code. Overpower It is a defect of the object selection system and the access restriction system, which makes it possible to perform operations that should not be possible. 

## DOS

 Arbitrary operation leads to damage to system availability. Due to the universality of dos, for example, enough access can always slam the system, it is generally recognized that the harm is due to the unintended factors, due to unintended behavior of the system.
