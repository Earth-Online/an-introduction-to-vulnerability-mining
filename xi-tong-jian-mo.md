# System modeling

The system modeling here does not refer to the system design in development, but to the model of system behavior constructed by white box or black box.

## white box

White box refers to the case of source code and design documentation. If you have a UML diagram \(a design language\), 

you can get a clear idea of the relationship between the system and the functions the system has \(expected\). If not, it can only be modeled by reading the code. Reading the code is also a technique. As the target audience of this book, it will not go deep, just mention it briefly.

 Code testing is a good entry, and testing always takes the form of an expected input with an expected output. You can get the expected behavior of the development from the test. In addition, 

if you can run the code, you can also understand the function of this system from the user interface. The final result should be able to be written as an expected form..

black box Just like you open a web site at random, there is no source code. It is a black box. You can only understand the input and output. At this time, you should combine your sensitive guessing ability. The guessing ability is often proportional to your development ability. Let's think about how you will achieve it if you are developing. What assumptions are there. 

Take this url as an example `test.com/paper.php?id=1&ret=test.com` Then you get an article and read back to test.com.

 It can be guessed that the id is the article id and ret is the return address. This site uses the database \(this may not be a fact, the webmaster can choose to write the file\) .

If the development unexpected parameter is manipulated, obviously he will only think of the id as the positive integer he entered. Established expected form

| input | limit | output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id |  | Corresponding article content |
| ret |  | Return url |

You can confirm our form by typing For example. 

If the input id is 0, the site prompts us to `not legal id`. It can be considered that the development actually expects an arbitrary id. 

With enough input, this expected table can be perfected to complete this modeling.
